The temperature-size rule states that organisms living in warmer temperatures will grow faster and mature earlier but ultimately attain a smaller maximum size at adulthood. Whilst several studies have documented patterns in average body size consistent with the temperature-size rule in wild populations, a test of the mechanism is lacking. Here, we use age and length data of 1.4 million fish across seven species from 2,704 lakes to quantify temperature-related variation in growth across ontogeny. Our results show that no species fully conform to the temperature-size rule; whilst patterns of juvenile growth rate and age at maturity typically aligned with the temperature-size rule, these changes seldom translated to reduced maximum size. We also found evidence that faster life histories in warmer environments are driven by reduced lifespan. A deeper understanding of how temperature shapes growth in natural systems is needed to accurately predict the impacts of global warming on wildlife.
